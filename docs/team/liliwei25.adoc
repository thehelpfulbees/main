=== Enhancement Added: Delete Multiple `delete INDEX...`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When the user wants to delete multiple users at once, it is inconvenient to call the `delete` command several times.
With the delete multiple enhancement, the user can just call `delete` once and enter all the persons he wants to delete.
