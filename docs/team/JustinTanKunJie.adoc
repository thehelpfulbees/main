*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/justintkj/main/blob/master/collated/main/justintkj.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/justintkj/main/blob/master/collated/test/justintkj.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: `Multiple Undo/Redo`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=undoredo]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When a large chunk of commands needs to be redone, it is inconvienent and inefficient to have to type the `undo` command. +
With an attached positive integer chosen by the user, user can redo alot of commands instantly with just one line of command. +
Original implementation of `undo` command is kept as it would be more inituitive for the user to not have to type the number of undos if only one is expected. +
Vice versa, multiple `redo` is made to undo multiple number of undo.

=== Enhancement Added: `Sort`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When the contacts list increases, the list of persons stored may be unorganized. +
Sorting is made possible for various type of parameters of users depending on the type of organization needed. +
The sort should be automatically updated in storage as it is inefficient for users who want a specified sort to need to type the same command everytime the application starts.


==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: `Favourite`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=favourite]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When the contacts list increases, finding a person important to the user may be tough. +
Favourite hightlights a person name with a red box to highlight importance of the person, becoming prominent when scrolling through the list. +
A sort can be made to filter all the favourite persons to the top of the list, easier to find important persons.

=== Enhancement Added: `Error Sound for invalid command`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=errorsound]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It is important to notify the user whenever an invalid command is given into the application. While the commandBox shows the type of error the user made, +
it is essential to prompt the user with a sound to notify an error, following which, then reads the commandBox for type of error. +
ErrorSound is called from ParseException and CommandException as a user's input which is rejected by the application would have to handle and error of
these two types.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=errorsound]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: `Autocomplete`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It reduces the amout of time needed to type a specified command and acts as a quick reference to a list of vaid command. +
When the user types a command in the CLI, recommended valid commmands are shown as a drop-down list for the user to choose. +
User can choose from the list of valid command via the keyboardd:[&uarr;] or keyboard:[&darr;] and select via kbd:[Enter]. +
Valid commands needs to be saved and increase the drop down list to provide more relevant commands for the user progressively. +
When XML file is deleted, a new XML file will be created, populated with a standard list of commands.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: `Email`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=email]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Provides a quick way to send an email to the selected person via our team's generated Gmail account. +
Javamail API is used to provide an efficient route to create an email message and to connect to the host server.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=EmailPerson]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: `Add (Alternative method)`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Provides an alternative way to add a person without using prefix, so user do not need to memorize a standard way to add a person. +
Regex is used to scan the entire message given by the user to extract relevant information fields. +
It is impractical to confirm a person's name to a certain regex, hence the name field must be the first field follow by a `,`

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=AddPerson]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: `Remark (Logic)`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

A field for user to attach a sentence to indicate relevance to user on a selected person. +
It acts as a reminder for the user what the remarked person mean.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: import command `import`

==== External behavior

---
Imports all the contacts from the user's chosen social media type into the application. +
Valid type of imports to be used: +
`import facebook` +
`import instagram` +
`import linkedin`

---

==== Justification

It is not practical to manually add every contact when initialising the application for the first time. +
By importing from the user's social media account, it provides a relevant base of contacts for the user to use.

==== Implementation

---
ImportCommandParser : Validate type of import chosen by user +
ImportCommand : Extract all contacts from the user's social media account and updates the storage with the new populated list of persons.
