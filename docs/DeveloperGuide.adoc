By: `F09-B3`      Since: `AUG 2017`      Licence: `MIT`      Referenced from: `AddressBook-Level 4`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::multipleundoredo[]
==== Multiple undo/redo mechanism
The undo and redo can be done multiple times, chosen by the user by a positive integer

UndoCommandParser : Accepts one more (optional) postive integer after the command `undo`. +
UndoCommand : Repeats the command for the requested number of times. +
UndoCommandParser : Accepts one more (optional) postive integer after the command `redo`. +
UndoCommand : Repeats the command for the requested number of times.

Multiple undos are implemented this way
[source,java]
----
for (int i = INDEX_ZERO; i < numUndo; i++) {
    if (!undoRedoStack.canUndo()) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
    }
    undoRedoStack.popUndo().undo();
}
----
Multiple redos are implemented this way
[source,java]
----
for (int i = INDEX_ZERO; i < numRedo; i++) {
    if (!undoRedoStack.canRedo()) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
    }

    undoRedoStack.popRedo().redo();
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `Multiple Undo Command` and `Multiple Redo Command` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):*undo/redo single undo/redo for chosen number of times one at a time*  +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality it is reusing the functionality of the original + undo/redo command

---
// end::multipleundoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== sort mechanism

The sort mechanism operates from sorting the 'internalList' in 'UniquePersonList' which resides in the model componet. Sort supports reformatting the current list of person according to the user's chosen details in ascending order. Such commands will inherit from `Command`.

With the help of sortCommandParser, the user's sorting type preference will be extracted from the CLI and passed into sortCommand.Invalid sorting type or command will not be sorted, and parseException will be generated:

image::SortCommandDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `SortCommandParser` validates and extract the user's sorting type request. SortCommand will call the model component to sort the 'interalList'. Invalid Commands will be handled by ParseException command to prompt user for a correct sorting type.

Commands that are not sortable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public SortCommand(String sortType) {
    this.sortType = sortType;
}

@Override
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    //... list logic ...
}
----
Commands that are not sortable will be handled by ParseException:
[source,java]
----
catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, SortCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `internalList` is filled with these four persons. A sample of the outlook of internalist is shown below.

image::OriginalInternalList.png[width="800"]

The user executes a new `SortCommand`, `sort number`, to sort all person in the address book by their phone number. interalList in 'UniquePersonList' should then be sorted.

image::SortedNumberList.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, the user can request for a different sort command. For example, the user may execute sort name to interalList by their name.

image::OriginalInternalList.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The user may choose to sort the persons by other parameters. The parameters includes : name, number, address, email, remark, birthday, favourite.

If a command fails its execution, no sorting will be done and a parse Exception will be used to handle the format for incorrect Commands.

A simple flow of Activity Diagram for how sort command operates is given:

image::SortActivityDiagram.png[width="300"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `SortCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the interalList via `Collections.sort()` and  +
**Pros:** We will be able to sort using merge or Tim sort which offers a stable and efficient (O(n log n)) efficiency +
**Cons:** May not be optimal when sorting again after adding one new person only. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement different algorithm depends on different type or number of persons added +
**Pros:** Able to obtain optimal efficiency for sorting everytime. +
**Cons:** Alot of code needed for all the different types of persons added to ensure better efficiency than Tim sort.

---

**Aspect:** Sorting persons based on type +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses Lambdas to sort. +
**Pros:** Clean one line code to compare person to sort. +
**Cons:** - +
**Alternative 2:** Individual Comparator for person object based on sorting parameter. +
*Pros:** Sort the persons based on comparator, more free play to the comparisons in sorting. +
**Cons:** Less efficient as more context switch is needed, resulting in higher overhead time.
// end::sort[]

// tag::favourite[]
=== Favourite mechanism
The favourite command toggles the favourite variable in the person to toggle a change in the highlight of color around
the person's name

FavouriteCommandParser : Parses the valid argument (positive and valid indexes) +
Favourite Command : Highlights the person chosen via model class to interact with the correct person. +
Person : Contains a Favourite class as it's parameter. +
Favourite : Contains two different state, to highlight or not to highlight. +
PersonCard : Updates highlight color for person.

Implementation to create a new person to replace the old person with the new favourite +
[source,java]
----
ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
ReadOnlyPerson editedPerson = personToEdit;
toggleColor(editedPerson);
editedPerson.setFavourite(favourite);
----

Implementation to toggle the color of the person shown in UI
[source,java]
----
name.textProperty().bind(Bindings.convert(person.nameProperty()));
if (person.getFavourite().toString().equals(TRUE_STRING)) {
    name.setStyle(RED_COLOUR);
} else if (person.getFavourite().toString().equals(FALSE_STRING)) {
    name.setStyle(NO_COLOUR);
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Toggle the color highlight of the person +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** use a string to indicate highlight +
**Pros:** May add different colors in future for different priorities +
**Cons:** More code, read string instead of boolean, typo may result in non-toggle +
**Alternative 2:** use a boolean to indicate highlight +
**Pros:** Rigid structure for red color and no color +
**Cons:** Not good for furthur enhancements +
---

// end::favourite[]

// tag::errorsound[]
=== ErrorSound mechanism
The Error sound mechanism plays a .mp3 sound file named "ErrorSound.mp3" whenevever an invalid Command
is typed by the user. +
User's invalid command are facilitated through ParseException and CommandException.
The play sound function can then be called through these two exception.

ErrorSound : Creates a mediaplayer and play the sound file chosen.
ParseException : Calls invalidCommandSound() in Sound.
CommandException : Calls invalidCommandSound() in Sound.

Implementation to activate the sound file in invalidCommandSound()
[source,java]
----
try {
    createsNewMediaPlayer();
    mediaPlayer.play();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    logger.info(ERROR_SOUND_LOG_MESSAGE);
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Plays the sound file when given invalid command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** use a mediaPlayer, look for the sound file and play +
**Pros:** Sound file can be replaced easily +
**Cons:** Reliant on ParseException and CommandException to play sound. If other Exceptions are added in future
implementation, might not play sound.

---
// end::errorsound[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== AutoComplete mechanism

The autocomplete mechanism uses controlsFX to bind an autocomplete drop-down list to the Command Line.
Every time the user enters a valid command, the command used will be added to the storage file to expand the
autocomplist of stored valid command.

CommandBox : Binds textfield with the CLI UI. +
XMLAutocomplete : Updates the list when given valid command and to store the list in an XML file. A new XML file will be created with a sample list of basic inputs if XML file is deleted.

Implementation to bind the list of valid inputs to the CLI
[source,java]
----
updateAutocompleteTextField();
autocompletionbinding = TextFields.bindAutoCompletion(commandTextField, mainPossibleSuggestion);
----

Implementation to store the valid new command into an XML file
[source,java]
----
if (!commandWord.equals(EMPTY_STRING)) {
    mainPossibleSuggestion.add(commandWord.trim());
}
XMLEncoder e = new XMLEncoder(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(AUTOCOMPLETE_FILE_NAME)));
e.writeObject(mainPossibleSuggestion);
e.close();
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Autocomplete drop-down list +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** use .bindAutoCompletion() to bind an array of valid string into the
autocomplete drop-down list.
**Pros:** Little code needed, storage base expands over usage time +
**Cons:** May not be automated test friendly as invalid command may be interpreted as valid command due to using the
kbd:[Enter].
---
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::EmailPerson[]

=== Email mechanism
The email mechanism uses JavaMail API to send an actualy E-mail using our team's designated email address. +
The selected user will receive an email at their email address if there's a valid internet connection.

EmailCommandParser : Validates and extract user's command for index, subject, and message. +
EmailCommand : Sends an Email to the email of the person selected.

Implementation to send the email
[source,java]
----
//Initial Login credentials
generateInitialLoginCred(personToEmail);

//Adds signature to user's text
String messageText = teamSignatureGenerator();
boolean sessionDebug = false;

Properties props = System.getProperties();

//updates the properties of the session
updateProperties(host, props);

//Compose the message
composeMethod(messageText, sessionDebug, props);

//Sends the Message
sendMessage(host, user, pass, mailSession, composedMessage);
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Sending an email +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** use your team's email address as the sender. +
**Pros:** No login credentials on user's part needed +
**Cons:** Users may use our team's email for illegal purpose. +
**Alternative 2:** User sign in to their own email. +
**Pros:** More secure on developer's email +
**Cons:** An extra step needed to send the email.

---
// end::EmailPerson[]

// tag::AddPerson[]

=== Add mechanism (Alternative)
The alternative add mechaism uses regex to search for valid input types in a given string. +
By using regex for searching for valid fields, the order of parameters to add a person is not neccessary. +
As PocketBook is made to target Singaporeans, the regex specifies the following to be true for the different parameters
of a person.
As name has no valid regex to it, it has to be the first parameter given, followed by `,`

Implementation to add a person
[source,java]
----
//Generate person's details
email = new Email (getOutputFromString(args, emailPatterns, EMAIL_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE));
blocknum = getOutputFromString(args, blockPatterns, BLOCK_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);
streetnum = getOutputFromString(args, streetPatterns, STREET_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);
unitnum = getOutputFromString(args, unitPatterns, UNIT_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE);
postalnum = getOutputFromString(args, postalPatterns, EMPTY_STRING);
phone = new Phone(getOutputFromString(args, phonePatterns, PHONE_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE)
        .trim().replace(COMMA_STRING, EMPTY_STRING));
birthday = validateBirthdayNotFuture(args);
address = generatesAddress(blocknum, streetnum, unitnum, postalnum);
Set<Tag> tagList = new HashSet<>();
ReadOnlyPerson person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, remark, birthday, tagList, picture,
        favourite);
return new AddCommand(person);
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Adding a person to pocketBook(Alternative) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** searches the string given for valid regex. +
**Pros:** No strict format to remember, natural for users to add user +
**Cons:** Users may not be familiar with independent fields constaints. +
**Alternative 2:** uses a prefix for each individual field. +
**Pros:** Less constraints on individual fields +
**Cons:** Users have to refer for different prefixes meaning and how to use them.

// end::AddPerson[]


// tag::remark[]

=== Remark mechanism
The remark mechanism enables an additional field for a person to have.
It is used as a note for a specified person.
RemarkCommandParser : Validates and extracts remark from the given input from the user. +
RemarkCommand : Adds the remark to the person selected.

Implementation to remark a person

ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
Person editedPerson = generateNewEditedPerson(personToEdit);
model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Editing a person's remark +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate a new person with a new remark and replace the old one +
**Pros:** Previous remark has nothing to do with current remark +
**Cons:** A new person needs to be generated. +
**Alternative 2:** Edits the current person's remark. +
**Pros:** Old person object remains the same +
**Cons:** Access to person needs to be given.

=== Delete Multiple Mechanism

The delete multiple mechanism is a edit of the previous `delete` command. It enables the user to delete several persons
from the address book in one command.

The `DeleteCommandParser` will parse all the given `Index`(es) provided by the user and creates a new `DeleteCommand` with the provided indices.
The `DeleteCommand` will then go through the list of `Person` and delete all the `Person` of the given `Index`

Implementation of deleting multiple `Person` from address book:
[source, java]
----
private String deleteAllSelectedPersonFromAddressBook() throws CommandException {
    StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(COMMA);
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    for (int i = targetIndex.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (targetIndex[i].getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        ReadOnlyPerson personToDelete =
                        lastShownList.get(targetIndex[i].getZeroBased());

        deletePersonFromAddressBook(joiner, personToDelete);
    }
    return joiner.toString();
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteCommandParser` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edit the parser to take in several values  +
**Pros:** Reduce the need for a new class and increases efficiency +
**Cons:** Editing the previous `DeleteCommandParser` is not ideal +
**Alternative 2:** Implement another parser called `DeleteMultipleCommandParser` +
**Pros:** Can call the `DeleteCommandParser` several times rather than creating a new algorithm +
**Cons:** Extra command. Extra classes. Reduces inefficiency as several `DeleteCommandParser` needs to be created

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edit the command to take in several `Index`  +

**Cons:** Extra command. Extra classes. Reduces inefficiency as several `DeleteCommand` needs to be created

// end::DeleteMultiple[]

// tag::Map[]
=== Addressing Mapping Mechanism

The mapping mechanism is facilitated by `MapWindow` and `MapCommand`, which resides within `UI` and `Model` component respectively.
It creates a new pop-up browser showing the `Address` of the selected `Person` on Google Maps.
This mechanism works side by side with the `Address` field of each `Person`.

`MapCommandParser` parses the `Index` entered by the user and passes it to a new `MapCommand` which will call the `Model` function to show
the selected `Person` address on a pop-up browser.

[NOTE]
Multiple maps can be opened at the same time.

Implementation of mapping in `MapWindow`:
[source, java]
----
private void displayMap(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    String mapUrl = GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_PREFIX
                + person.getAddress().getMapableAddress().replaceAll(SPACE, PLUS)
                + GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL_SUFFIX;
    map.getEngine().load(mapUrl);
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of browser +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shows map on new pop-up browser  +
**Pros:** Allows multiple maps to be shown +
**Cons:** Required more browsers to be shown and may slow down the processing speed of the app +
**Alternative 2:** Shows map on the built-in browser on app UI +
**Pros:** Removes the need for more pop-up windows +
**Cons:** Unable to show several maps at once

**Aspect:** Implementation with or without Google Maps API +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement map with browser and Google Maps URl +
**Pros:** Reduce the need to include Google Maps API with may slow down the app and increase size of app +
**Cons:** The browser may not be as reliable compared to the API +
**Alternative 2:** Implement map with Google Maps API +
**Pros:** More stable and reliable compared to using browser and URL +
**Cons:** Increases app size and may slow down app

// end::Map[]

// tag::RemoveTag[]
=== RemoveTag mechanism

The removetag mechanism is facilitated by `RemoveTagCommand` and `RemoveTagCommandParser`, which resides within the `Logic` component.
It deletes the tag specified by the user from all or one `Person` selected by the user.
This mechanism works side by side with the `Tag` list of each `Person`.

`RemoveTagCommandParser` parses the `Index` specified by the user and passes it to a new `RemoveTagCommand`.
If no `Index` were specified by the user, the `Tag` will be deleted from all the `Person` in the address book.

[NOTE]
The `Tag` will also be deleted from the list of tags in the address book if it is deleted from all `Person`

Implementation of removing tag from single `Person`:
[source, java]
----
private String removeTagFromPerson(int index) throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    ReadOnlyPerson person = lastShownList.get(index);
    boolean result = removeAndUpdate(person);
    if (!result) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_TAG_NOT_FOUND_IN_PERSON);
    }
    return person.getName().fullName;
}
----

Implementation of removing tag from all `Person`:
[source, java]
----
 private void removeTagFromAllPerson() throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    for (ReadOnlyPerson person: lastShownList) {
        removeAndUpdate(person);
    }
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation to delete `Tag` from all or single `Person` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows users to choose between deleting from single or all `Person` +
**Pros:** Allows more freedom for the user +
**Cons:** Requires more processing and more prone to errors +
**Alternative 2:** Only allow user to delete `Tag` from all `Person` +
**Pros:** Reduces the complexity and reduces chances for errors +
**Cons:** Very rigid. User cannot choose to delete from single user and may not be useful.

// end::RemoveTag[]

// tag::Background[]
=== App running in background mechanism

The background app mechanism is facilitated by the `MainApp`. It creates a system tray icon whenever a new PocketBook app is started.

`MainApp` first determines if the system tray is supported in the current platform. It then creates a tray icon with a pop-up menu.
It will try to add the tray icon to the system tray and provides an easier access to the app. Moreover, it will be able to reduce subsequent startup times of the app.

[NOTE]
The app can only be exited fully using the `Exit` command or menu option.

Implementation to add icon to system tray:
[source, java]
----
private void startTray() {
    Platform.setImplicitExit(false);
    if (!SystemTray.isSupported()) {
        logger.warning(MESSAGE_TRAY_UNSUPPORTED);
        return;
    }
    initTrayIcon();
    try {
        tray = SystemTray.getSystemTray();
        tray.add(trayIcon);
    } catch (AWTException e) {
        logger.warning(MESSAGE_ADD_TRAY_ICON_FAIL);
    }
}
----
// end::Background[]

// tag::Image[]

=== Image mechanism

The image mechanism is facilitated by the `ImageCommandParser` and `ImageCommand`, which resides within the `Logic` component,
It adds/edits/removes the `ProfilePicture` of a `Person`.

`ImageCommandParser` parses the `Index` provided by the user and passes it to a new `ImageCommand`. +
If `remove` is detected in the input, the `ProfilePicture` of the selected by the user will be deleted and reset to default. +
Else, a file browser pop-up to allow user to choose which picture they would like to choose as the `Person` 's `ProfilePicture`.

Implementation of `ImageCommand`:
[source, java]
----
private ReadOnlyPerson updateDisplayPicture(List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList,
    ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit) throws PersonNotFoundException {

    ReadOnlyPerson editedPerson;
    if (remove) {
        editedPerson = removeDisplayPicture(personToEdit);
    } else {
        editedPerson = selectDisplayPicture(lastShownList, personToEdit);
    }
    return editedPerson;
}
----
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of method to choose file +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Opens a FileChooser dialog to allow user to choose photo +
**Pros:** Allows more freedom for the user +
**Cons:** Requires more processing and more prone to errors +
**Alternative 2:** Only allow user to input the file location in CLI +
**Pros:** Reduces the complexity and reduces chances for errors +
**Cons:** Very rigid. User will have a hard time finding the file path of the image.
// end::Image[]

// tag::BirthdayNotifier[]
=== Birthday and Birthday Notifier mechanism

The birthday notifier mechanism is facilitated by a `BirthdayNotifier`, which resides within the `Model` component.
It creates a pop-up every time the app is run to inform the user of any birthdays that happen to fall on that day.
This mechanism works side by side with the `Birthday` field of each `Person`.

`BirthdayNotifier` is created and run in the `MainApp` every time the app is run. `BirthdayNotifier` will then check
through the `Birthday` of the list of `Person` that was passed in from `MainApp`. It will then create a
`BirthdayPopup` to show the list of `Person` with birthdays on that day. These relationships are illustrated in the
diagram below.

image::BirthdayNotifierDiagram.png[width = "800"]

Implementation of checking through all the `Person` in `BirthdayNotifier`:
[source,java]
----
for (ReadOnlyPerson e: list) {
    if (e.getDay() == date && e.getMonth() == month) {
        people.add(e.getName().toString());
    }
}

if(people.size() > 0) {
    createPopup(people.toArray(new String[people.size()]));
}
----

The popup creation is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
private JDialog frame = new JDialog();
private GridBagConstraints constraints = new GridBagConstraints();

public BirthdayPopup(String[] person) {
    createFrame(person.length);
    createIcon();
    createCloseButton();
    createMessage(person);
    createPopup();
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `MainApp` will create `BirthdayNotifier` to check
through the `Birthday` s.

If there is at least one `Person` with a birthday on that day, `BirthdayNotifier` will create a new `BirthdayPopup`
at the bottom right hand corner to inform the user. An example is shown below.

image::BirthdayPopup.png[width = "400"]

[NOTE]
If the `Person` 's birthday is not set, it'll not affect `BirthdayNotifier`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `BirthdayNotifier` works:

image::BirthdayNotifierSequenceDiagram.png[width = "800"]

[NOTE]
If there are no birthdays on that day or if the address book is empty, no popup will be shown.

The following activity diagram summarize what happens when a user runs the application:

image::BirthdayNotifierActivityDiagram.png[width = "200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** When to show popup +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show popup during startup of application +
**Pros:** User will most likely see the popup since the user just started the application +
**Cons:** Popup may not show when the date has changed +
**Alternative 2:** Show popup when the date changes +
**Pros:** The birthday list is constantly updated and shown to user +
**Cons:** The user may not be paying attention and will miss the popup +
**Additional Information:** planning to implement both options

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of `BirthdayPopup` frame +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using JDialog +
**Pros:** JDialog does not create an application bar in the task bar +
**Cons:** JDialog does not come with default buttons for maximizing or minimizing +
**Alternative 2:** Using JFrame +
**Pros:** JFrame comes with default buttons to close, maximize and minimize etc. +
**Cons:** JFrame will create an application bar in the task bar (ugly)

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of `BirthdayPopup` timer +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a timer to close the popup after 5 seconds +
**Pros:** Closes the dialog automatically and duration of pause can be changed +
**Cons:** The user may not get a chance to see the popup +
**Alternative 2:** Don't use a timer +
**Pros:** The user determines when to close it and gets a chance to see the popup +
**Cons:** The user has to manually close it. Maybe be troublesome. +
**Additional Information:** Planning to implement a timer reset when the mouse hovers above the popup

---

**Aspect:** Size of popup +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Size of popup depends on the number of birthdays +
**Pros:** The message will not be lost and it can contain any amount of names +
**Cons:** The popup may get very large +
**Alternative 2:** Fixed size for popup +
**Pros:** Very neat and consistent +
**Cons:** If the list of names gets too big, some names will not be shown +

---
// end::BirthdayNotifier[]

// tag::findbytag[]
=== Find command

The 'find' command was originally used only to search for users by name. Now it can be used to display all members of a single tag. An example of its use is shown below:

    AddressBook contains: Alfred (tagged as friend), Bruce (tagged as colleague), Richard (tagged as both friend and colleague)
    User enters the command: find t\friend
    ---------------------
    The program returns by listing: Alfred and Richard

The FindCommand class itself relies on having a search predicate passed to the constructor as input, so that class required fairly minimal modification to take a predicate of type TagContainsKeywordPredicate as well as NameContainsKeywordsPredicate.

The FindCommandParser includes code to differentiate between a search by name and by tag, and produces either a TagContainsKeywordPredicate or NameContainsKeywordsPredicate as appropriate.

image::FindCommandArchitecture.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Specificity of user input +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users are required to enter the full and exact tag name, including case +
**Pros:** System will not output persons not in the intended tag +
**Cons:** Inconvenient for users who forget or misinput the exact names of tags +
**Alternative 2:** System searches all tags that contain the given keyword +
**Pros:** More convenient to users who do not wish to remember the exact name of every tag +
**Cons:** May return output that is unintended by the user (e.g. listing members of "girlfriend" when the user searches for "friend") +

---

**Aspect:** Can only search by a single tag at a time +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users may enter one tag as a keyword by which to search by +
**Cons:** Users may wish to search for the intersection of a tag and another tag, or a tag and a name (e.g. all friends named John) +
**Alternative 2:** Searching for multiple tags returns the intersection of those tags +
**Pros:** Allows users to very easily track down individuals by specifying which groups they are in +
**Cons:** Makes it difficult to construct complex large subsets of the addressbook +
**Alternative 3:** Searching for multiple tags returns the union of those tags +
**Pros:** Useful when one 'category' of persons might be split across multiple tags +
**Cons:** Makes it difficult to track down individuals by inputting all tags that they are in +

---

// end::findbytag[]


// tag::numtimessearched[]
=== Tracking and sorting by number of times searched

Every person has an invisible numTimesSearched field that begins at 0 and is incremented by 1 every time they
found by the `find` command.

The `sort` command has been enhanced to allow for displayed users to be sorted by numTimesSearched,
so that the most-searched persons appear at the top. An example of its use:

    AddressBook contains: Malcolm (searched for 3 times), Tony (searched for 0 times), and Julia (searched 10 times).
    User enters the command: 'sort numtimessearched'
    ---------------------
    The program returns by listing: Julia, Malcolm, Tony
    ---------------------
    User enters this command five times: 'find Tony'
    User enters this command: 'sort numtimessearched'
    ---------------------
    The program returns by listing: Julia, Tony, Malcolm

This field required the creation of the class numTimesSearched, which contains the integer value,
and methods for incrementing and returning the value.

ParserUtil.java was updated to implement the new sorting method: notably, while other fields are sorted lexicographically,
this field had to be compared numerically
(e.g. lexicographically, 5 would come after 10, which is not the intended way to sort).

---
// end::numtimessearched[]

// tag::Fuzzyfinder[]
=== Fuzzyfinder

The 'fuzzyfind' command largely operates like the 'find' command, with the caveat that it searches all substrings of contact names, not just words of contact names. This can be illustrated with the following example:

    AddressBook contains: Simon, Jim, Chrissi
    User searches for: Si
    ---------------------
    'find' command: returns nothing
    'fuzzyfind' command: returns Simon, Chrissi (both contain 'si')

Fuzzyfind differs from Find by the predicate being used to test each user input string with each AddressBook Name string. In this case, a new Predicate Subclass called 'NameContainsSubstringsPredicate' was created that uses 'string.contains()' instead of 'string.equals()' to check for the existence of substrings.

Firstly the FuzzfindCommandParser breaks up the user input string by whitespaces and stores each smaller string in a string array. It then initializes a new FuzzyfindCommand object with the aforementioned 'NameContainsSubstringsPredicate' attribute. This results in the predicate being called during the '.execute()' method of the FuzzyCommand class, which will in turn update FilteredList of the current model object. Thus displaying all the users that match the predicate.

Note that a substring match can return a lot more unexpected results than a strict word match, so it is best used if the 'find' command does not return the person you are looking for, or if you cannot remember the exact name of the person.

---
// end::Fuzzyfinder[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
